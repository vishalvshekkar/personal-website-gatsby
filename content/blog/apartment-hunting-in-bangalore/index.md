## Apartment hunting in Bangalore is a nightmare

I am a 25-year old male. I am currently looking for apartments to move to. I presently live in a studio apartment and want a bigger place.

The following are what I got asked and told in the last few months.

1. Are you married?
2. Are you a non-vegetarian?
3. Do you have a girlfriend?
4. Do you do drugs?
5. Do you play loud music?
6. How can I let a single boy stay when there are families living here?
7. We don’t want any trouble.
8. We have strict rules about not getting home after 11pm.
9. You cannot cook non-veg; Eggs are okay.
10. Do you smoke?
11. Do you drink?
12. You can’t drink in my building.
13. You cannot spend more than an hour on the terrace.
14. Are you a decent guy?
15. I have daughters, I won’t let bachelors live here.
16. Will you be sharing try apartment with someone else?
17. Are you a brahmin?
18. Do you have parties at home?
19. Do you bring friends home? We don’t allow that.
20. The security guard will keep an eye out on your comings and goings and report to me, beware.

I understand the the importance of an owner making sure their tenants are not creeps and wouldn’t destroy their property. But, most of these questions are extremely personal and shouldn’t be anybody’s business but my own.

What if I had friends over? What if we had a couple of drinks and had great conversations? As long as we are quite and don’t disturb my neighbors, how does it matter? What if some of my friends were female? Why is that a problem?

What if I had whomever I’m seeing over? What if I brought my date home? Yes, we may be having sex, we may also be doing so many other things. We could be cooking, we could be watching a movie or just talking to each other over some tea. As long as we don’t disturb my neighbours physically, there’s nothing wrong, is there?

The concept of personal space seems to be absent with a lot of people.

It’s insulting to be spoken to rudely, to be investigated, your character be assumed to be the worst and put on a pedestal to prove that you’re actually ‘good’ in someone’s else’s perspective.
